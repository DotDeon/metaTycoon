Meta Tycoon
Meta Tycoon is a collection of 9,999 generative artwork NFTs, each with unique traits. The project also includes a metaverse real estate ownership component, with all NFT holders co-owning real estate in the metaverse and receiving profits from the sale or rent of the real estate in USDT/ETH. Additionally, NFT holders are given exclusive benefits as members of the Meta Tycoon Club.

The project was developed using NextJS for the front-end and Solidity for the smart contract. An access-controlled backend was also implemented, which restricted login access to only those who currently own an NFT. All funds were managed in a Firebase database.

Please note that the project is no longer in use and is provided here for educational purposes only.
